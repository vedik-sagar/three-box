## Simple Box - Threejs
A simple three js-based project that uses drei and fiber.

**Setup**
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
Next Version 13 is used, which comes up with React 18, 
I have made a Simple example that uses all three dependencies of the front end, if this works out the front end would. I don't why this thing is required to "**CHECK**", when npm packages aren't getting installed in the first place which can be easily checked, after the next 13, versions have React 19 and three isn't compatible with any of those, hence next 14,15 are ruled out from the scene at last, If you try to manually upgrade the next 13 to 15 and downgrade react 19 to 18, it won't work out, React Internal APIs were changed, and would get this,

 They are together in a package for a reason, But if you managed to make the next 15 with react 18
 you would get this which you would be able to zoom in and out,

 or else the next 14 would still give you a blank black background.
